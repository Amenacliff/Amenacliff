### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Kevwe Amena (Cliff) , a Backend Software Engineer with over 3 years of professional experience, I use Typescript, Golang, and the Rust Programming language along with its frameworks to build scalable backend solutions -  I'm also a bit experienced with the frontend, so I can architect and implement solutions from start to finish.

I am specialised in Designing, and Implementing Large scale distributed systems, exploring event-driven & Reactive systems across different tech stacks and infrastructure, I personally love communication between micro services, which made me specialise in PUB/SUB Channels for micro services

I am the creator of Color Palette from Image, a Figma plugin to help designers get Focus colors from pictures, for a design theme ( https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1008382434333520774/Palette-From-Image ) and ColorPalette Hub ( The Online tool ) : https://www.colorpalettehub.com/
